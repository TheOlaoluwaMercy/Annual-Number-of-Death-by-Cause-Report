# Annual-Number-of-Death-by-Cause-Report
This report is for the analysis of global data on number of death due to different causes from 1990 to 2019.
## Objectives
The primary goal of this analysis is to investigate global mortality trends, causes of death by category, and the top-ranking countries and region/continent. 
## Report Overview 
The report is made up of a global summary page and a page dedicated to the top 4 countries and their top causes of death.
## Metric
This analysis utilizes two key metrics: total deaths and mortality rate, defined as deaths per 100,000 population. Total deaths offer a raw count of lives lost, illustrating the scale of the issue, while mortality rate adjusts for population differences, enabling equitable comparisons across regions and populations. These metrics together provide a comprehensive view of mortality patterns, aiding in objective assessment and informed decision-making.
## Datasets
- Annual cause of death dataset (1990 -2019)
- Continents and Countries dataset
- World Population dataset
- Death cause category dataset
## Tools used
- Power BI
- Power Query
- Excel
## Processes
- Data Cleaning
- Data Transformationn
- Data Modelling
- Data Visualization
## Summmary
The analysis showed a total of 1.47billion deaths and a mortality rate of 24 death per 100,000 population for 1990-2019.
Globally, non communicable diseases especially cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death. Also, non-communicable diseases caused the highest number of death in all continents except Africa where infectious diseases caused the highest number of death.
China, India, USA, and Russia were the top 4 countries respectively by total number of death recorded. The top causes of death in these four countries are cardiovascular diseases, neoplasm, chronic respiratory diseases, digestive diseases, lower inflammatory diseases, Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, self-harm, neonatal disorders and diarrheal diseases. There’s an upward trend of death caused by cardiovascular diseases and neoplasm in most of these countries.
The highest share of total deaths was from Asia.
Globally, there is a decreasing mortality rate trend, despite an increasing trend in total deaths. This suggests that relative to population size/increase, fewer people are dying. This also implies that advancements in healthcare, improved access to medical services, and public health initiatives have been successful in reducing the relative risk of death within the population.
